This project involved developing a Java-based system for tracking users' health information and calculating Body Mass Index (BMI), offering insights into BMI ranges. The system includes custom-designed classes, such as the MyHealthData class, to manage health data efficiently. Additionally, comprehensive JUnit tests were implemented to ensure system functionality and reliability through consistent validation. The project also includes well-documented Javadoc comments for all classes and methods, enhancing maintainability and providing clear documentation for future developers.
